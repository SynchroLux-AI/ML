<b> K-Means Algorithm in Machine Learning </b>

The **K-Means algorithm** is an unsupervised machine learning technique used for clustering data into groups based on their similarities. It is particularly useful when you want to identify patterns or groupings in a dataset without predefined labels. Below, I'll explain how K-Means works and how it can be applied to the **Iris dataset**.


<b> How K-Means Works </b>
1. **Initialization**:
   - Choose the number of clusters, `K`, you want to create.
   - Randomly initialize `K` centroids (points that represent the center of each cluster).

2. **Assignment Step**:
   - Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on a distance metric (commonly Euclidean distance).

3. **Update Step**:
   - Recalculate the centroids by taking the mean of all data points assigned to each cluster.

4. **Repeat**:
   - Repeat the assignment and update steps until the centroids stabilize (i.e., they no longer change significantly) or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

The algorithm minimizes the **intra-cluster variance**, which is the sum of squared distances between data points and their respective cluster centroids.


<b> Iris Dataset Overview </b>
The **Iris dataset** is a classic dataset in machine learning, containing 150 samples of iris flowers. Each sample has four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The dataset is divided into three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. However, in clustering tasks like K-Means, the species labels are ignored because it is an **unsupervised learning algorithm**.

<b> Applying K-Means to the Iris Dataset </b>
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Load the Iris dataset.
   - Normalize the features (optional but recommended) to ensure that all features contribute equally to the distance calculations.

2. **Choosing K**:
   - Use methods like the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters, `K`. For the Iris dataset, `K=3` is often chosen because there are three species of flowers.

3. **Clustering**:
   - Apply the K-Means algorithm to group the data into three clusters.
   - Each cluster will ideally correspond to one species of iris flower.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Compare the clustering results with the actual species labels (if available) to evaluate the performance. Metrics like **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)** or **Silhouette Score** can be used.
